Halo CEA (MCC) Extended S3DPAK

This is a resource for modders, not an actually playable mod.
This will allow you to use anniversary graphics for most stock halo tags (characters, weapons and vehicles) on every campaign map for custom missions. 
Simply replace the initial_tpls.s3dpak, and the s3dpaks and imetas for the included levels.

You can also add these additional custom/modified tags to your map which are linked to Anniversary graphics objects from the Extended S3DPAKs

* energy sword
* flamethrower
* fuel rod gun (plasma_cannon)
* rocket warthog
* scout hog
* senti beam

STEAM WORKSHOP DOES NOT SUPPORT ANNIVERSARY GRAPHICS. You must REPLACE existing stock maps in order to be able to use Anniversary Graphics mode.
When making an Anniversary compatible map, NEVER remove existing placed objects from the stock campaign scenarios, simple set them to not placed and remove script references instead.

HUGE THANKS to Zatarita and Lord-Zedd whose tools made this possible.
