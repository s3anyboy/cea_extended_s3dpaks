Halo CEA (MCC) Extended S3DPAK - TAGS

STEAM WORKSHOP DOES NOT SUPPORT ANNIVERSARY GRAPHICS. You must replace existing stock maps in order to be able to use Anniversary Graphics mode.

These custom/modified tags are linked to Anniversary graphics objects from the Extended S3DPAKs

Tags:
Characters:
cyborg.model_animations - Digsite shared animations (slightly modified), allows player usage of energy sword, plasma cannon, wraith, pelican, etc


Vehicles:
scout_hog - Originally sourced from halomaps.org, modified to better suit MCC

Weapons:
baton - landing signal baton weapon (energy sword clone)
energy sword - energy sword with first person animations (by SOI_7), replace the original "energy sword.weapon" with energy_sword_cea.weapon" to give it to sword elites
plasma_cannon_cea - MP fuel rod (plasma_cannon) with anniversary graphics support, uses banshee/hunter fuel rod projectile and effects and fr weapon label, replace "fuel rod.weapon" to give it to fuel rod grunts
sentinel - sentinel fuselage bit repurposed as a weapon, 3p only (no fp model/anims)
flamethrower - replaces flame.projectile and flame char.effect for anniversary graphics support

Known Issues:
Picking up the sword in tag_test causes it to crash (but it is fine ingame)

General CEA Map tips:
NEVER remove placed objects from campaign scenarios, simple set them to not placed and remove script references instead.
